# Begginer-s-Exercises-in-Python
Hello! I'm taking a specialization course in Data Science and I'm loving it! I'm loving it so much that I'm trying migrate from my current job to this area. I am going to share every step of the way I'm going through, probably you won't see the best solutions all the time and the best programming either, but definitely you will see some improvement and harder challenges in every level we advance.  
The only purpose here is to share some simple exercises in Python for begginers which will use concepts such as: Functions, Boolean, Variables, Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries. Very basic concepts and extreme important ones though. 
Please, feel free to share your opinion, your feedback is very important to me!
